# WonderTale.kids - Project Conversation Summary

## Date: January 6, 2026

---

## Project Overview

**Goal:** Create a kid-friendly website for generating personalized AI stories
**Domain:** wondertale.kids
**Tagline:** "Adventure starts with your name"

---

## Conversation Flow & Decisions

### 1. Initial Concept Discussion

**User's Vision:**
- Website for kids to generate stories
- Kids can only enter their names (security feature)
- Everything else is dropdown selections:
  - Pronouns
  - Age (3-9)
  - Story world
  - Antagonist/challenge
  - Story length (short, medium, long with max 4-5 paragraphs)
  - Reading level based on age

**Security Rationale:**
Limiting input to dropdowns prevents prompt engineering hacks and ensures kid-safe content.

---

### 2. Brand Name Brainstorming

**User Request:** Quirky, memorable name (not generic like "kidsstories.com")
Examples given: Twitter, Facebook, Retool, DoorDash

**Brainstormed Names:**
- Storybubble
- Talesprout
- Whooshstory
- Fableflip
- Yarnville
- TaleHaven ⭐
- WonderSprout
- WonderTale
- Questling
- Heropath

**User's Favorites:**
- Tale, Sprout (liked words separately)
- Haven
- Wonder

**Final Combinations Explored:**
- TaleHaven
- WonderSprout
- WonderTale

**FINAL DECISION:** WonderTale.kids
- User loved the .kids domain
- Perfect fit: clear, magical, signals it's for children

---

### 3. Tagline Development

**Two Finalists:**
1. "Where every kid is the hero"
2. "Adventure starts with your name"

**Research Conducted:**
I searched existing children's book websites and personalized story platforms to ensure uniqueness:
- Storytailor: "Imagination has a home address"
- MyStoryBot: No clear tagline
- StoryBee: "AI-powered story generator for kids"
- I See Me: "See Their Smiles of Joy!"

**Analysis:**
Both taglines were unique. "Adventure starts with your name" was stronger because:
- Directly references the core personalization feature
- Creates anticipation and excitement
- Simple enough for kids to understand
- Implies action and engagement

**FINAL DECISION:** "Adventure starts with your name"

---

### 4. Brand Voice & Messaging

**Tone Requirements:**
- Encouraging and empowering
- Safe
- Wonder-filled
- Warm but not overly sweet

**Key Messages for Parents:**
- Safe & age-appropriate
- Personalized magic (child becomes the hero)
- Builds confidence
- Encourages reading
- Sparks imagination

**Sample Copy Created:**
- Hero section tagline
- Feature descriptions
- Safety messaging
- Story creator instructions (kid-friendly language)

---

### 5. Security & Safety Features Discussion

**Critical Decision:** No free-text prompts except name input

**Rationale:**
- Prevents prompt injection attacks
- Ensures content stays appropriate
- Protects against malicious input
- Simplifies moderation

**Implementation:**
- All selections via dropdowns/visual buttons
- Only the name field accepts text input
- Age, pronouns, world, challenge, length all pre-defined options

---

### 6. Design & Color Palette Development

**User Request:** Great kid colors with palette options

**Initial Approach:**
Created landing page with 3 color palette options in CSS (commented out versions to switch between)

**User Feedback:** "Holy hell that looks great!"

### 11. Content Guidelines for AI Story Generation

4. Respect chosen pronouns
5. Educational value (friendship, problem-solving, courage)

**Story Structure Template:**
```
Opening: Introduce [childName] in [storyWorld]
Challenge: [childName] meets [challenge]
Adventure: [childName] uses [positive trait] to overcome obstacle
Resolution: Success through [bravery/kindness/cleverness]
Closing: Empowering message about [childName]'s abilities
```

**Vocabulary by Age:**
- Ages 3-4: Simple words, short sentences, repetition
- Ages 5-6: Basic descriptive words, slightly longer sentences
- Ages 7-9: More complex vocabulary, varied sentence structure

**Length Guidelines:**
- Short: 50-100 words (bedtime for younger kids)

### 14. Integration Points for Kiro

**API Endpoint Needed:**
```
POST /api/generate-story

Request Body:
{
  "childName": "string",
  "pronouns": "he/him | she/her | they/them",
  "age": "3-9",
  "storyWorld": "castle | space | jungle | ocean | mountains | city",
  "challenge": "dragon | robot | wizard | pirate | monster | alien",
  "storyLength": "short | medium | long"
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "story": {
    "title": "string",
    "content": "string",
    "generatedAt": "timestamp"
  }
}
```

**JavaScript Hook:**
The form submission in wondertale-generator.html has a placeholder where Kiro's API call should go:
```javascript
// Line ~XXX in wondertale-generator.html
// This is where you'd integrate with Kiro's backend
```
